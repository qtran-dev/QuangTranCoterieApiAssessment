# QuangTranCoterieApiAssessment
My submission for Coterie's API Assessment.

If I had more time...

1.) I would have better implemented exception handling. Responses are generic, some are undhandled, and I didn't utilize the Error Handler.
2.) Added authentication
3.) Created unit tests. I ran out of time and do not know NUnit, I am only familiar with XUnit.
4.) Use AutoMapper / DTO layer
